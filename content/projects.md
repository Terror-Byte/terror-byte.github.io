# Invdrs

Invdrs (prounounced "Invaders") is a clone of the classic
game Space Invaders I made using the Godot game
engine in early 2021.

Godot is a game engine that caught my eye due to how
approachable and lightweight it is, and how quick and
easy it is to prototype games in it. To get stuck into Godot I
decided to clone Space Invaders, the reason being that I
could break down an existing game into it's core
mechanics and focus on implementing them instead of
having to worry about designing a game myself.

Technologies used:
Godot, GDScript
