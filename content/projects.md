# Unreal Invdrs
![alt text]()

Unreal Invdrs is a clone of my Godot game Invdrs made in
Unreal Engine 5 as one of my 2022 learning objectives at
Lab42.
Much like my Unity implementation of Invdrs from the year
before, my goal was to get back into Unreal Engine, as I
hadn’t used it since university, to ready myself if I had to
use it at work. Again, I knew exactly what I needed to
implement as I’d done so twice before instead of having to
design the game from scratch.

Technologies used:
- Unreal Engine 5
- Blueprints

# Unity Invdrs
![alt text]()

Unity Invdrs is a clone of my Godot game Invdrs made in
Unity as my 2021 learning objective at Lab42.
My goal with Unity Invdrs was to get my head back into
Unity and polish my skills so I was ready whenever I next
needed to use it at work. As I’d already made this game in
Godot, I knew exactly what I needed to implement and
could focus on the Unity specifics instead of having to
design the game from scratch.

Technologies used:
- Unity
- C#
- Visual Studio

# Invdrs
![A screenshot of my Godot game Invdrs](/images/projects/invdrs-cover-photo.png)

Invdrs (prounounced "Invaders") is a clone of the classic
game Space Invaders I made using the Godot game
engine in early 2021.

Godot is a game engine that caught my eye due to how
approachable and lightweight it is, and how quick and
easy it is to prototype games in it. To get stuck into Godot I
decided to clone Space Invaders, the reason being that I
could break down an existing game into it's core
mechanics and focus on implementing them instead of
having to worry about designing a game myself.

Technologies used:
- Godot
- GDScript

# Clerical Error
![A screenshot of my LD46 Game Jam Game Clerical Error](/images/projects/clerical-error-screenshot.png)

Clerical Error is a game a couple of friends and I made in Unity for the
Ludum Dare 46 game jam in April 2020, the theme of which was "Keep It
Alive".
In Clerical Error the player takes the role of a cleric in a party of
adventurers whose job it is to keep their brave band of companions alive
whilst they slay the monstrous dragon. It is the player's responsibility to
move their party members around the battlefield (allowing them to dodge
the dragon's deadly fireballs), heal them when they've taken too many hits
and revive them when they die.
My friend Josh and I took responsibility for the programming of the game,
and our friend Liz created the art. Alongside programming, I also made the
music and sound effects for Clerical Error. I made the the music for the
game with Bosca Ceoil and the sound effects with JFXR.

# Dawn
![A screenshot of my final year university project Dawn](/images/projects/dawn-screenshot.png)

Dawn is an adventure game made with Unreal Engine as part of
the Game Development module during the second semester of
my final year of university in 2017. The intention of this project
was to give us a taste of working in a team alongside artists,
working together to make a small game.
The aim of the game is for the player to escape the old house
they are in, solving puzzles to advance. The puzzles mainly
involve blocking off light sources which are shining over the exits
to the various rooms of the house, as the player character has a
skin condition which causes them harm when they are in direct
sunlight.

Technologies used:
- Unreal Engine 4
- C++
- Visual Studio

Plunder! is an adventure RPG made with Unity as part of the
Team Project module during the second semester of my second
year of university in 2015. The aim of this project was to give us
students experience working in a team and producing a product
together.
In Plunder! you play as a Viking with a taste for treasure who sails
from island to island, clearing them of hostile beasts, collecting
the coins and weapons they drop and using their gold to upgrade
their stats - allowing them to acquire more treasure.

# AMON
![A screenshot of my first year university game jam game AMON](/images/projects/AMON-screenshot.png)

Amazing Midget Over Normandy (AMON) is a simple action game developed with the
Monogame framework and C# that was made as part of my first ever game jam. The
game jam took place at my University in the first semester of my first year of uni (late
2013). The aim of this game jam was to get the new students acquainted with each
other and to give us experience working on a game in a team.
The theme of the jam was “Random Game Name Generator”. Each team was given
three spins of the Video Game Name Generatorand had to choose one of the
generated names as the title for their game. If they did not like any of the three names
generated, the team could gamble on a fourth spin which they would have to take.
'Amazing Midget Over Normandy' is what our team chose from our 3 generated names.
In AMON the player takes the role of a vertically-challenged paratrooper tasked with
paratrooping into occupied Normandy during WW2.
The player has to avoid clouds (which wet the parachute and make the player fall
faster), missiles shot from the ground and later on planes which fly in from the sides of
the screen. The player has to survive 60 seconds to win the game. There is a shield
power-up that the player can collect (if an enemy missile hits an enemy plane) that
renders them invincible against the effects of clouds and allows them to survive one hit
from an enemy plane or missile without dying.

Technologies used:
- Monogame
