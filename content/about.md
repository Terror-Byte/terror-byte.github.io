Hi, I'm Liam and I've been a programmer at Lab42 Games for the past 3 years! I'm a passionate game developer and I love being a part of an industry that provides entertainment for so many people worldwide.\ \
In my spare time I've been enjoying learning my way around the Godot game engine to further my hobby game development endeavours, as well as tinkering with Rust to have a robust low-level language in my personal toolbelt.\ \
Aside from hobby game development, some of my other interests are:
- Playing video games (surprising, I know ðŸ˜‰).
- Playing Guitar.
- Linux.
- Split Mechanical Keyboards.
